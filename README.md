# Correlations-T-tests
Basic Statistics in Python (Correlations &amp; t-tests)

This project is for people who are interested in statistics, particularly carrying our statistical analysis in Python. In this project will be taking data from the World Bank. They have one data set on science and technology, and that's what we'll be looking at throughout this project.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Clean the data and remove null values to prepare it for statistical analysis.
2.	Extract descriptive statistics on the data.
3.	Create boxplots to show outliers.
4.	Use correlations and scatter plots to examine relationships between the data.
5.	Use t-tests to compare data from different years.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Load data from World Bank.
- __Task 2:__ Clean the data to remove any missing values and unnecessary columns.
- __Task 3:__ Perform exploratory data analysis and plot the measures.
- __Task 4:__ Plot multiple boxplots and explore any outliers.
- __Task 5:__ Create a correlation matrix and scatter plots to examine relationships.
- __Task 6:__ Carry out t-tests on the data and use box plots to visualise the results.
